# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application: I published a gem! Install it: gem install nyc_subway_status, then run 'nyc-subway-status'
- [x] Pull data from an external source: pulling from http://alert.mta.info/
- [x] Implement both list and detail views: trains with service changes have subpages, which I load when a train number is entered
